# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q4

**IPFS project knows where it's heading and how**
- `P0` IPFS project vision and goals published and peer-reviewed
- `P0` IPFS project roadmap 1.0 exists and nearer-term goals fleshed out into milestones
- `P0` 2019 project priorities defined and agreed upon with the wider community
- `P1` IPFS project decides on and starts measuring 3+ KPIs

**IPFS working groups are empowered, organized, and efficient**
- `P1` All working groups have 2019 priorities and roadmaps
- `P1` All working groups grade Q4 OKR and draft Q1 OKRs before Q1 starts
- `P1` Working group captains have a regular forum for cross-wg communication and prioritization
- `P2` Each working group sources at least 2 requests from other working groups for candidate OKRs

**IPFS team coordination protocols and tools are tuned and supported**
- `P1` 3+ "project-level PRs" proposed and prototyped (ex spec review, team roles, communication channels)
- `P2` IPFS Weekly Meeting increases attendance or views by 2x (by becoming more useful/better run)
- `P2` ???
